## 📖 **About**

AI.yam aims to develop a monitoring system for the chicken farming industry using AI-based computer vision technology to address critical challenges in the industry. Chicken farmers typically rely on manual observation to monitor the health and behavior of chickens, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in large-scale operations. This approach not only limits productivity but also delays responses to issues that could affect the health of the entire flock.

## 🌱 **Theme**

**Smart Agri-Fishery Solution:** Agrotech and Fisheries Technology Integration.

## 🧐 **Problem Statement**

The Chicken industry lacks an efficient, scalable system for tracking flock health and density, resulting in missed signs of illness, overcrowding, and delayed response to mortality, which can lead to economic loss and compromised animal welfare.

## ❓ **Research Questions**

How can an AI-based computer vision system improve chicken monitoring by accurately detecting flock health metrics such as chickens count, mortality, and crowd density?
